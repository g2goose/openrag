## What is knowledge
## The role of OpenSearch
## The index (only 1, possibly soon easier to rename)
## Auth modes (maybe use a partial)


OpenRAG includes a built-in [OpenSearch](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/) instance that serves as the underlying datastore for your _knowledge_ (documents).
This specialized database is used to store and retrieve your documents and the associated vector data (embeddings).

The documents in your OpenSearch knowledge base provide specialized context in addition to the general knowledge available to the language model that you select when you [install OpenRAG](/install-options) or [edit a flow](/agents).

You can [upload documents](/ingestion) from a variety of sources to populate your knowledge base with unique content, such as your own company documents, research papers, or websites.
Documents are processed through OpenRAG's knowledge ingestion flows with Docling.

Then, the [OpenRAG **Chat**](/chat) can run [similarity searches](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-search) against your OpenSearch knowledge base to retrieve relevant information and generate context-aware responses.

You can configure how documents are ingested and how the **Chat** interacts with your knowledge base.

## OpenSearch authentication and document access {#auth}

When you [install OpenRAG](/install-options), you provide the initial configuration values for your OpenRAG services, including authentication credentials for OpenSearch and OAuth connectors.

:::warning
Google is the only supported OAuth provider for OpenRAG.

Other [OAuth credentials](/reference/configuration#oauth-and-cloud-storage-connector-settings) are used only to authorize cloud storage connectors.
:::

The presence of Google OAuth credentials determines how OpenRAG authenticates with your deployment's OpenSearch knowledge base, and how it controls user access to documents in your knowledge base:

* **No-auth mode**: If you don't provide Google OAuth credentials, then the OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base runs in no-auth mode. This mode uses one anonymous JWT token for OpenSearch authentication. There is no differentiation between users; all users that access your OpenRAG instance can access all documents uploaded to your knowledge base.

* **OAuth mode**: If you provide Google OAuth credentials, then the OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base runs in OAuth mode. This mode uses a unique JWT token for each OpenRAG user, and each document is tagged with user ownership. Documents are filtered by user owner; users see only the documents that they uploaded or have access to through their cloud storage accounts.

:::tip
To enable OAuth mode after initial setup, you must [configure the Google Drive cloud storage connector for document ingestion](/ingestion#oauth-ingestion).
This is because OpenRAG uses Google OAuth credentials for both OAuth mode _and_ the Google Drive cloud storage connector.

## OpenSearch index {#index}

An [OpenSearch index](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/getting-started/intro/#index) is a collection of documents in an OpenSearch database.

By default, all documents you upload to your OpenRAG knowledge base are stored in an index named `documents`.

It is possible to change the index name by [editing the ingestion flow](/agents#inspect-and-modify-flows).
However, this can impact dependent processes, such as the [filters](/knowledge-filters) and [**Chat**](/chat), that reference the `documents` index by default.
Make sure you edit other flows as needed to ensure all processes use the same index name.

If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior after changing the index name, you can [revert the flows to their original configuration](/agents#revert-a-built-in-flow-to-its-original-configuration), or [delete knowledge](/knowledge-browse#delete-knowledge) to clear the existing documents from your knowledge base.
